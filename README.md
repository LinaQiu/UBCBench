# UBCBench
UBCBench contains all benchmarks we designed for confirming our hypothesized findings while analyzing the three well-known static taint analysis tools, FlowDroid+IccTA, Amandroid, and DroidSafe. 

# UBCBench Results - DroidIccSourceSinks.xlsx
We ran all benchmarks with the three aforementioned tools, using the same tool configurations and [sources and sinks list (DroidIccSourceSinks)](https://resess.github.io/PaperAppendices/ISSTA2018.html#ExperimentalSetup) we described in our ISSTA paper. We analyzed all tool analysis results and provided our analysis results, along with the ground truth in the excel file called "UBCBench Results - DroidIccSourceSinks.xlsx".
